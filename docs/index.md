## Introduction

TvM Assistant is a Discord bot with utility commands to make hosting TvMs easier. You can invite it to your server by using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=680383600725590020&permissions=268494928&scope=bot). Inviting the bot will give it `Manage Channels`, `Manage Roles`, `Manage Messages`, `Add Reactions` and `Embed Links` permissions in addition to `Read` and `Send` messages perm.

## Features

- Creates necessary setup roles and channels
- In-built logging which detects and ignores private channels
- Manages sign ups, sign outs and replacements
- Supports quick creation of player, mafia and spectator chats
- Manages cycle channels
